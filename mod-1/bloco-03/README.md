# Block 03 - Introduction to HTML & CSS

In this block we learned the basics of HTML and CSS: the main HTML tags, CSS selectors, main styles, how to connect both and such.

The Project was **Lessons Learned**, a very simple portfolio-like webpage in which we listed the main lessons so far.

You can view the [deploy of the project here](https://heyset.github.io/sd011-project-lessons-learned/).
