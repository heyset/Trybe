# Block 04 - Introduction to JavaScript

In this block we had our introduction to programming logic with JavaScript. We learned about types, loops, conditionals, functions, objects.

The project was **Playground Functions**, a basic algorithm project in which we developed classic algorithms such as FizzBuzz and also practiced string manipulation with JS.
