# Trybe - Matheus "Set" Inacio

This repository is home to almost all exercises and projects I am developing while studying at [Trybe](https://betrybe.com).

Feel free to explore and poke around :D

## What's in this repo?

Mostly projects in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Sometime in the future you'll also find some in Python.

Some of them are deployed and you can visualize them in GitHub Pages.

Others are not that visual.

Most of them are in Brazilian Portuguese, since at the time I'm currenlty studying the course is taught exclusively in Portuguese and I decided to follow suit in order to allow my colleagues to understand my code.

Most of the code itself is in English, except for content that is displayed to the end user. You can still understand many of the examples even if you don't speak Portuguese.

## How is the repo structured?

There are two main sections: content and projects.

Content refers to smaller exercises developed during the content days, and they are divided into the 4 modules (mod-1, mod-2, mod-3, mod-4).

Projects are longer works taking at least a full day, but most ranging from 3 to 5 days, and some spanning weeks. Some of them were group projects, and others were individual.

All relevant sub sections have READMEs of their own.

## Repository Index

Here you will find link to the content blocks, as well as links to the projects of each block. Some of those will have deployment links.
